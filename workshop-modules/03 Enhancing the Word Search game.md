# Enhancing the Word Search game

Now it is time to add even more features to our Word Search game. This is the part of the workshop where GitHub Copilot really becomes the assistant that makes you excel and improve your skills. 

## Don't be a copy paste champion

As you go through the exercises below, **remember to read the output from Copilot and do your best to understand that output**. It can be tempting to just copy and paste like a Stack Overflow champion, but this is a real opportunity to learn how to build an application in a new way.
