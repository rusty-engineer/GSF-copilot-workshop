# Enhancing the Word Search game

Now it is time to add even more features to our Word Search game. This is the part of the workshop where GitHub Copilot really becomes the assistant that makes you excel and improve your skills. 

## Don't be a copy paste champion

As you go through the exercises below, **remember to read the output from Copilot and do your best to understand that output**. It can be tempting to just copy and paste like a Stack Overflow champion, but this is a real opportunity to learn how to build an application in a new way. 

## More features to implement

The aim for this session is to add 1 or 2 new features to your version of the game. Really make it your own. 

Below is a list of potential features you can implement in your Word Search game to enhance its gameplay and user experience:

1. **Timer:** Add a timer to challenge players to find all the words within a set time limit.

2. **Hints:** Provide players with hints or clues to locate difficult words.

3. **Word Categories:** Categorise words and allow players to choose specific categories for their game (e.g., animals, food, sports).

4. **Multiplayer Mode:** Enable multiplayer functionality to allow multiple players to compete against each other in finding words.

5. **Levels:** Implement multiple levels of difficulty, with larger grids and more complex word placements.

9. **Custom Word Input:** Allow players to input their own word lists or themes.

10. **Game Progression:** Track players' progress, levels completed, and best times.

11. **Sound Effects:** Add sound effects for interactions and game completion.

12. **Leader boards:** Implement leader boards to track and compare high scores among players.

13. **Tutorial Mode:** Offer a tutorial mode for new players to learn how to play.

14. **Word Search Generator:** Develop an algorithm to dynamically generate new word search puzzles.

15. **Dark Mode:** Provide a dark mode option for players who prefer it.

16. **Accessibility Features:** Ensure the game is accessible to players with disabilities, including screen reader compatibility.

17. **Save and Resume:** Allow players to save their progress and resume games later.

18. **Achievements:** Include achievements or badges for completing specific challenges.

19. **Social Sharing:** Enable players to share their achievements and scores on social media.

20. **Custom Themes:** Offer different visual themes or backgrounds for the game.

21. **Word Count:** Display the number of words found and remaining during gameplay.

22. **Puzzle Generator:** Create a puzzle generator that allows players to input their own words and generate a unique puzzle.

23. **Auto-Save:** Automatically save progress at specific intervals to prevent data loss.

24. **Language Support:** Provide support for multiple languages and word lists.

25. **Word of the Day:** Showcase a "Word of the Day" feature with a unique puzzle.

26. **Daily Challenges:** Offer daily challenges with new puzzles and rewards.

27. **Offline Mode:** Allow players to enjoy the game even when offline.

## Giving Copilot instructions

When you implement any of these features with Copilot's help, consider these points

1. **Define Feature Requirements:**
   - Clearly define the requirements and objectives of the feature you want to implement.
   - Specify how the feature will enhance the gameplay experience for players.
2. **Research Existing Solutions:**
   - Explore existing implementations of similar features in other Word Search games or related projects.
   - Analyse their functionality, user interface, and implementation details.
3. **Identify Key Components:**
   - Break down the feature into smaller, manageable components or tasks.
   - Identify the core functionalities and interactions required to implement the feature.
4. **Write Natural Language Comments:**
   - Write clear and descriptive natural language comments that outline the feature's functionality and requirements.
   - Provide context and examples to guide Copilot in generating relevant code snippets.
5. **Trigger Copilot Suggestions:**
   - Start writing code around your comments to trigger GitHub Copilot suggestions.
   - Experiment with different comments and prompts to guide Copilot effectively.
6. **Review and Customise Suggestions:**
   - Review the code suggestions provided by Copilot and evaluate their relevance to your feature requirements.
   - Customise and refine the generated code to align with your specific needs and design preferences.
7. **Iterate and Refine:**
   - Iterate on the implementation based on user feedback and testing results.
   - Refine the feature to improve performance, usability, and overall user experience.
