   - Pay attention to user-reported issues, error messages, or anomalies observed during gameplay.

#### 2. Reproduce the Bug:
   - Attempt to reproduce the bug consistently by following specific steps or interactions within the game.
   - Record the steps taken to trigger the bug and note any patterns or conditions that may contribute to its occurrence.

#### 3. Analyse Code Surrounding the Bug:
   - Navigate to the relevant sections of the codebase where the bug may be originating.
   - Review the code surrounding the suspected bug area, paying attention to logic flow, variable assignments, and function calls.

#### 4. Use Copilot for Debugging Suggestions:
   - Write natural language comments describing the bug symptoms and the expected behaviour. Use Copilot chat to tell it what the issue is.
   - Trigger Copilot suggestions by writing code snippets or descriptions related to the bug.
